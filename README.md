# DNA methyltransferases 3A and 3B target specific sequences during mouse gastrulation

Files in this directory are supporting Mukamel et al. work on Dnmt3a/b activity during gastrulation.

This is a reviewers version for maximizing transparency. Further organized scripts and documented files will be available prior to publication.

Scripts in the `rna` directory can reproduce metacell derivation and analysis generating figure panels 1-3. The metacell models used in the papers are also provided.

DNA methylation data is provided in a processed form to ease up analysis, and the scripts that reproduce it are provided as jupyter notebooks at `methylation` directory. 

The processed files can be downloaded from:

For both scRNA-seq and 5mC data, raw data is being deposited in GEO.

A running [MCView](https://tanaylab.github.io/MCView/) app is live at:
